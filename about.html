        <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">
        I'm a <a id="a" href="https://www.brookekryan.com" target="_blank">Princeton PhD student</a> studying Computational Psychology and Artificial Intelligence. I recently graduated with my M.S. in Computer Science from UC Irvine. I received my undergraduate degree in Math-Computer Science from UC San Diego in 2017. I worked for 3 years as a <a id="a" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brookekryan/" target="_blank">software engineer</a> at Intuit Inc. and Blizzard Entertainment. I’ve also taught for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program.
        <br><br>
        I viscerally remember how intimidated I was in my first programming class. There's so many new concepts, tools, and technologies to learn; I felt overwhelmed and I wondered if I would even be able get through. To make matters more challenging, Computer Science is often taught with large, impersonal lectures and rote memorization which makes these subjects even harder to grasp. I remember being frustrated with the disconnect between theoretical concepts presented in class and the vastly different untaught skills required for the programming assignments.
        <br><br>
        Fast forward 10 years from that first CS class—I’m now a PhD student in Computational Psychology and a former professional Software Engineer—I haven’t forgotten how challenging those first few learning experiences in this field were. I'm passionate about making challenging topics in CS accessible to all learners, and I don't believe that you have to be innately gifted or have been programming since you were a toddler to become proficient in Computer Science. I think often what new learners need is someone there to patiently guide them through those first few steps as they build the confidence to solve challenging problems.
        <br><br>
