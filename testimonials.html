      <li id="listElt"> "Ms. Ryan’s cadence when expressing herself and articulating her ideas are stellar. She is a master in
        presenting clear concepts, leading results-oriented discussions, modeling technical concepts, and creating
        a path for student understanding...I believe there are some who “teach” and there are others who are “called.” Ms. Ryan is definitely
        “called” to be an educator. Her compassion for students, commitment to her own academic and
        professional growth, and her acts of service and leadership make her an excellent candidate and veritable
        contributor to Computer Science research and education." <em>Girls Who Code Supervisor, Summer Immersion Program</em></li>

        <li id="listElt"> 
            "Brooke is an amazing tutor, and it was a pleasure working with her. She was very nice and considerate, treating my questions seriously and taking the time to make sure I understood core concepts. She was relatable and made me feel at ease throughout the session, which helped me to learn better overall. Overall, I highly recommend her and would book another session! Thank you."

            "Brooke has many strengths. She was very enthusiastic about helping students and
            teaching the class. She explained concepts clearly and
            frequently encouraged people in class to participate. She always made sure to ask if
            anyone had any questions. She included interactive exercises in her mini
            lectures/presentations." <em>UCI graduate student TA review</em>
